        <h1>Creative productivity tricks on Linux with Vim and Pandoc</h1>
        <p>
            <em>
	    A while back I had an internship for which some research needed to be done. 
	    During that time I was taking notes with Vimwiki. When a meeting was spontaneously scheduled, I needed to present my findings clearly. In this post I will demonstrate how to generate reports or presentations from notes on the fly.

	I will also demonstrate a neat trick for storing random ideas or a diary.
	And since this post is about productivity; at the end I'll quickly mention something unrelated that single-handedly made me healthier -- using newsboat with pi-hole.

        <p>
	In practice, you write your notes in Vimwiki, incorporating the markdown extension - and snippets. Then with some keybinds you can easily turn them into a presentation or report.

		<li> <span class="marked-text">Vim</span> (+ some vim-plugins that will be discussed)</li>
		<li> <span class="marked-text">Markdown</span> </li>
		<li>  <span class="marked-text">Pandoc</span></li>

        <h2 id="vimwiki">Vimwiki</h2>
	<p>
        <em>
		If you are familiar with using Vimwiki and markdown: skip to the <a href="#scripting">Scripting</a> section.
	</em>
	<p>
    Vimwiki is a tool used for keeping personal notes. <span class="underl">It's essentially just writing a file in vim, but with added functionality</span> which allows you to create file hierarchies and navigate through these hierarchies quickly.
    Let's first install Vimwiki by adding the plugin to your <span class="highl">vimrc</span>, assuming you're using vim-plug;
    <pre><code class="language-vim">
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
...
Plug 'vimwiki/vimwiki'
...
call plug#end()
    </code></pre>
    <p> 
    If you're new to using vim-plug, find all of your information on <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug" target="_blank">their GitHub page</a>.
    Here are the only Vimwiki keybinds you need to familiarise with for using it:
    	 
    </p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="marked-text">Enter on word</span> -- creates a wiki on this word</li>
    <li><span class="marked-text">Enter on a wiki</span> -- navigates to that wiki</li>
    <li><span class="marked-text">Backspace</span> -- moves to previous wiki</li>
    <li><span class="marked-text">Ctrl + i</span> -- toggles wikis in a file</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can see how this could be very useful for going deep into a subject or just keeping regular notes. However, there are some things that I consider indispensable for really using it. Here is the config code in my <span class="highl">vimrc</span>, which I will explain in what follows.
</p>

            <pre><code class="language-vim">
let g:vimwiki_list = [
\ {
\   'path': '~/.../notebooks/',
\   'index': 'index',
\   'syntax':'markdown',
\   'ext': '.md',
\   'auto_export': 0,
\   'template_default': 'default',
\   'template_ext': '.tpl',
\   'nested_syntaxes': {'python': 'python', 'bash': 'sh'},
\ }
\ ]
map <leader>wi :VimwikiIndex&lt;CR&gt;
set conceallevel=1
            </code></pre>
        </p>
	<p> 
           You can see I defined the <span class="highl">~/.../notebooks</span> directory as a starting directory. It's bound to <span class="highl">leader wi</span>. You can pick any directory, and obviously multiple directories, to configure accordingly. The default filetype is set to markdown here.  The <span class="highl">set conceallevel=1</span> will make your markdown files easier to look at; it will conceal ugly syntax. 
	</p>
        <p>
	If you're not very familiar with what this all means, I'll refer you to <a href="https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html" target="_blank">the vim documentation</a>. Don't get intimidated! It's very simple.
        </p>
        <p>
            I should mention that by default wikis will be created in the same directory. By using <span class="highl">folder/wikiname</span> on words you enter, your wiki will exist in a subfolder. This keeps order. In my example video, my folder looks like this:
	    <div class="directory-structure">
    <ul>
        <li class="dir">~/.../notebooks
            <ul>
                <li class="file">index.md</li>
                <li class="dir">Newton
                    <ul>
                        <li class="file">Newton.md</li>
                        <li class="file">binonium.md</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>


        </p>
        <p>
	If you'd want to use my Vim configurations, you can find my full config file on my GitHub. Learn to use it before setting this up. For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki" target="_blank">the official Vimwiki GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
	<h3 id="snippets">Snippets</h3>
        <p>
            To make markdown lightning fast, snippets are used. Before discussing how they work, I'll show you how to configure them. We need the following plugins now:
    <pre><code class="language-vim">
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
...
Plug 'vimwiki/vimwiki' " as discussed prior
Plug 'SirVer/ultisnips' 
Plug 'honza/vim-snippets'
Plug 'lervag/vimtex' 
Plug 'godlygeek/tabular'
Plug 'preservim/vim-markdown' 
...
call plug#end()
    </code></pre>
    <p> 
    	Where ultisnips is the snippet-engine. It makes everything work. Vim-snippets is a set of snippets, so you don't have to create all of them yourself. Vimtex is used for LaTeX compiling with vim and more, but we will use it for our math-mode compilation. Lastly tabular and vim-markdown are just used so that markdown features will be naturally integrated.
    </p>
    <p> 
    	These are the configurations to go along with the snippet-engine;
	<pre><code class="language-vim">
let g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger="&lt;tab&gt;"
let g:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger="&lt;tab&gt;"
let g:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger="&lt;c-z&gt;"
let g:UltiSnipsSnippetDirectories=["UltiSnips","Snippets"]
let g:UltiSnipsEditSplit="vertical"
	</code></pre>
    </p>
        <p>
            By default, the <span class="highl">tab</span> trigger will not work for markdown. Add the following lines to your vimrc to fix this;
            <pre><code class="language-vim">
autocmd FileType vimwiki UltiSnipsAddFiletypes markdown
au filetype vimwiki silent! iunmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;Tab&gt;
autocmd FileType vimwiki set filetype=markdown
            </code></pre>
        </p>
<p> 
	    The snippets are kept in <span class="highl">~/.vim/UltiSnips/markdown.snippets</span>.
	<p> 
	    Here's a snippet example that was used in the demo-vieo:
	</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
snippet inf "Info for new wiki" b
---
${1:title: "$2"}
${3:author: "$4"}
${5:date: "$6"}
---
$7
endsnippet
            </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            A snippet works as a way to turn any combination of symbols into something you defined. 
	    They're written in the aforementioned file. Let's go over the syntax and the workings of this snippet line by line. 

	    <p> 
    To start a definition, the syntax goes 
    <pre><code class="language-bash">
snippet word "discription of snippet" behaviour
    </code></pre>
	    <p> 
    	where "snippet" is standard syntax. The "word" is what will expand when typed. Behaviour will determine how it will expand. There's three important options to know when it comes to behaviour; 
	<ol>
    <li><span class="highl">b</span> will make it so that the expansion will only happen if the trigger is typed at the beginning of the line.</li>
    <li><span class="highl">i</span> will make it so that the expansion will happen at any place, and is therefore more general than <span class="highl">b</span></li>
    <li>There is an option to use <span class="highl">A</span> for auto-expansion. <span class="underl">If you don't use A, you will have to use an expansion-trigger</span>. The <span class="highl">Tab</span> key is used for this.</li>
	</ol>
	    </p>
	    <p> 
	    In between the "snippet" "endsnippet" lines, anything can be written. The <span class="highl">$i</span> determines where your keyboard will focus and in which order! You can write a standard response by using <span class="highl">${i: text}</span> that you can replace, or keep by tabbing over it. I hope my video, where I use this <span class="highl">inf</span> snippet, makes things clear.
	    </p>
        <p>
            In this case, you see how it gives you the ability to easily make your filetags. And you can do so much more; for my LaTeX snippets I have one snippet which includes an entire template. From there I just put my <span class="highl">$</span> signs in the right place. It's very powerful.
        </p>
	<h3 id="Math mode">Math mode</h3>
        <p>
	In case you won't ever be needing to put math in your notes, feel free to ignore this part.
        <p>
            Let's now discuss how I defined math mode within my markdown.snippets file, and the vimrc. This makes snippets that only expand when you're writing mathematics. Make sure to have the vimtex plugin for this. Write the following code at the top of your <span class="highl">~/.vim/UltiSnips/markdown.snippets</span> file.
            <pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
global !p
def math():
    return vim.eval('vimtex#syntax#in_mathzone()') == '1'
endglobal
            </code></pre>
        </p>
	<p> 
		Then add the following line to your <span class="highl">vimrc</span>:
		<pre><code class="language-vim">
let g:vim_markdown_math = 1
		</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p> 
		To go into math mode, we use <span class="highl">dm</span> and <span class="highl">mk</span>, which I use because of <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/" target="_blank">Gilles Castel</a> his amazinig blog post. Define them accordingly in your <span class="highl">markdown.snippets</span> file;
		<pre><code class="language-vim">
snippet dm "Display Math Mode" bA
\$\$
${1:math}
\$\$$0
endsnippet
		</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p> 
	this "display math" snippet will be used for mathematics that is on a new line. As apposed to; 
		<pre><code class="language-bash">
snippet mk "Inline Math Mode" i 
\$${1:math}\$$0
endsnippet
		</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p> 
		which is used for inline mathematics. 
	</p>
        <p>
            Here's a snippet -- also used in the demo -- that is only defined in math mode. <span class="underl">This snippet will only be activated when in a "math" environment</span>, which means within the <span class="highl">$</span> signs.
            <pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
context "math()"
snippet sum "som" iA
\sum_{k=$1}^{$2} $3 
endsnippet
            </code></pre>
        </p>
	<p> 
		If you are in need of more info on snippets, or if you want a plethora of math mode snippets, I'll direct you to <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/" target="_blank">Gilles Castel's blog post on the matter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets" target="_blank">his snippets</a> respectively. They're more clever than what I could ever come up with. 
	</p>
        <h2 id="pandoc">Pandoc</h2>
        <p>
            Pandoc is a very extensible program. We will use it to convert our markdown files to presentations. Converting markdown to presentation PDF happens with the following <span class="underl">general</span> command:
            <pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
$ pandoc input.md -t beamer -V theme=theme -V colortheme=colortheme -o output.pdf
            </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="highl">-t beamer</span> option is what we use to indicate we want a presentation. After -V theme and colortheme we can pick a theme. Here is the example command I use:
            <pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
$ pandoc Newton.md -t beamer -V theme=Singapore -V colortheme=albatross -o Newton.pdf
            </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            As you see I always use the Singapore theme and albatross colortheme. All of the availables are on <a href="https://hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/" target="_blank">this cool website</a>, they're great! You could make your own themes as well. Try not to take it too far!
        </p>
        <p>
	For reports, the command is ofcourse different.
        </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
pandoc "$filename" -t latex -V geometry:margin=1in -V colorlinks=true -V linkcolor=blue -V toccolor=gray -V documentclass=report -o "$basefilename.pdf"
            </code></pre>
        <p>
	With this we'll generate a nice clean LaTeX report. If you want to explore the options I'll refer you to <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html" target="_blank">the pandoc documentation</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="scripting">Scripting</h2>
        <h3 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>
        <p>
            At last, it can all be tied together by writing a simple script which generates our presentation or report in an instant. Let's start with the script for a presentation. Then we will bind this script to a Vim remap.
            <pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
#!/bin/bash

# the %p option in the vimrc will give the path
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Error: No file path provided, check your vimrc trigger definition"
  exit 1
fi

# Get the full file path
fullpath=$1

# Extract file name and directory from the full path
filename=$(basename -- "$fullpath")
dirname=$(dirname -- "$fullpath")
basefilename="${filename%.*}"

cd "$dirname" || exit

# Convert Markdown to PDF using Pandoc
pandoc "$filename" -t beamer -V theme=Singapore -V colortheme=albatross -o "$basefilename.pdf"

# Check if PDF was successfully generated
if [ -f "$basefilename.pdf" ]; then
  echo "Presentation generated: $basefilename.pdf"
  # Opening the file with MuPDF with standard zoom of 350
  mupdf -r 350 "$basefilename.pdf" &
else
  echo "Error generating presentation."
  exit 2
fi
            </code></pre>
	    <p> 
	    	Save this script in <span class="highl">~/.local/bin</span> as <span class="highl">generate_presentation.sh</span>. Make it executable by running <span class="highl">chmod +x generate_presentation.sh</span>. Finally add the following line to your vimrc: 
	    </p>
            <pre><code class="language-vim custom-code">
nnoremap <Leader>pg :call system('/home/dyntif/.local/bin/generate_presentation.sh ' . shellescape(expand('%:p')))<CR>:echo "Presentation generated successfully!"<CR>
            </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
	Change <span class="highl">user</span> with your username.
        <p>
            This will activate the script with the <span class="highl">leader pg</span> key combination. The <span class="highl">:silent !..</span> option will make it so that you won't be plagued with outputs. The <span class="highl">%p</span> option will give the script the name of the file and directory you're working in. <span class="underl">This would work with any markdown file</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, I use mupdf viewer to show me the presentation. This is a very lightweight and easy to use viewer for powerpoints or other pdfs. Perfect for our task! the <span class="highl">-r 350</span> option creates a standard zoom. Using <span class="highl">H</span> when in the presentation sets it right for your client resolution according to height.
        </p>
        <h3 id="reoprt">Report</h2>
        <p>
	Now let's do almost the exact same thing for generating a report. I'll note that you could change the previous script to work with report or presentation options, but I thought it'd be easier to just make two seperate scripts. 
        </p>
        <p>
	Copy the existing script <span class="highl">cp ~/.local/bin/generate_presentation.sh ~/.local/bin/generate_report.sh</span>.
	Change the pandoc line -- <span class="highl">10</span> -- in the script above with the report one I mentioned earlier.
        </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
# pandoc "$filename" -t beamer -V theme=Singapore -V colortheme=albatross -o "$basefilename.pdf" OLD
pandoc "$filename" -t latex -V geometry:margin=1in -V colorlinks=true -V linkcolor=blue -V toccolor=gray -V documentclass=report -o "$basefilename.pdf"
            </code></pre>
        <p>
	And we'll rewrite the last section to use <span class="highl">zathura</span>, the perfect pdf-viewer for the job. Make sure you have it installed.
	</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
if [ -f "$basefilename.pdf" ]; then
  echo "Presentation generated: $basefilename.pdf"
  # mupdf -r 350 "$basefilename.pdf" & OLD
  zathura "$basefilename.pdf" &
else
  echo "Error generating report."
  exit 2
fi
            </code></pre>
        <p>
	Make sure it's executable, same as before!
	We'll map this to <span class="highl">rg</span>.
	</p>
            <pre><code class="language-vim custom-code">
nnoremap <Leader>rg :call system('/home/dyntif/.local/bin/generate_report.sh ' . shellescape(expand('%:p')))<CR><CR>

	Imagine you're hard at work when, out of nowhere, a brilliant idea descends from the heavens straight into your mind. All you need is a terminal that runs this script, <span class="underl">it will automatically bring you to a premade entry file in your desired folder.</span> You'll be in insert mode beneath a predefined chapter with the current date and time.
	</p>
	<p>
	You just write what you're thinking in markdown and close the file. Your entries for every week will be saved in seperate files. A link to each week's entries is kept in an index file. <span class="underl">If you run the script, write nothing and close the editor, no new header will be created.</span> This is done with the last if statement.
	</p>
	<p>
	I am not able to think of a more easy way of storing thoughts, quick and easily accessible. <span class="underl">Using our presentation/report technique from above, you can read back your notes in a good looking format!</span> 
	</p>
	<p>
	The way I set it up, as shown in the mini-demo, I aliassed it in my <span class="highl">~/.bashrc</span>.
	<p>
	<pre><code class="language-bash custom-code">
alias idd='~/.local/bin/idee.sh'
	</code></pre>
	<p>
	For this to work, save the above script as <span class="highl">~.local/bin/idee.sh</span> and make it executable <span class="highl">chmod +x ~/.local/bin/idee.sh</span>
	</p>
	<p>
	Make sure to alter the script so that the folder is made in your desired location.

	After realising how unhealthy and unreasonable it was for me to continue using YouTube and other sites, I decided to get a Raspberry Pi and block them with Pi-hole. I then created a strong password, which I wrote down and left somewhere at home so that I couldn't access the blacklist — yes, you could simply unplug the Raspberry Pi, but I knew that to  be a line I wouldn't cross. 
	However, after doing this, I realised I couldn't maintain the block indefinitely. I needed to revisit a video related to one of my courses, and the bans bothered me so much that I eventually retrieved the password and unblocked them again.
	</p>

<p>
It wasn't just about missing some older videos; there were also channels I needed to keep following. But having everything unblocked was too distracting. Let me also note that while I’m saying YouTube, this applies to many other sites as well.
</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>
I made use of a server I have in my residence. First, I downloaded all the content from useful channels using <span class="highl">yt-dlp</span>, which was the obvious first step.
</p>

<p>
I then set up <span class="highl">newsboat</span> and added all the necessary news links. However, if you block the sites again now, no video player will work with newsboat (the sites are blocked), meaning you still wouldn’t be able to watch those videos. Here’s the first workaround:  
I reconfigured the server’s DNS settings so that it wouldn’t be affected by Pi-hole, then created a macro bound to a script that would download the video on the server. The script would then mount the folder containing the downloaded video on my laptop — you'll need to set up SSH configurations for this — and play the video locally with mpv.
</p>

<p>
I'll share the macro and the script on the local side, as those were tricky.
</p>

	<pre><code class="language-bash">
macro w set browser "~/.local/bin/download-server.sh %u" ; open-in-browser ; set browser linkhandler
	</code></pre>

	<pre><code class="language-bash">
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <link>"
    exit 1
fi

# Server configuration
SERVER_USER="dyntif" 
SERVER_IP="192.168.0.249"  
REMOTE_SCRIPT="~/.local/bin/download-video.sh"
LOCAL_MOUNT_POINT=~/persoonlijk/superfiles/problematisnoi
DOWNLOAD_DIR="$LOCAL_MOUNT_POINT/yt/vandaag/"

# 1. Execute the download script on the server
ssh "$SERVER_USER@$SERVER_IP" "$REMOTE_SCRIPT '$1'"

# 2. Mount the server folder locally
sshfs "$SERVER_USER@$SERVER_IP:/home/$SERVER_USER/superfiles/problematisnoi" "$LOCAL_MOUNT_POINT"

# 3. Find the most recently downloaded video
latest_file=$(ssh "$SERVER_USER@$SERVER_IP" "find ~/superfiles/problematisnoi/yt/vandaag/ -type f -printf '%T@ %p\n' | sort -n | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-")

# 4. Check if a file was found
if [ -z "$latest_file" ]; then
    echo "No new video found to play."
    exit 1
fi

# 5. Play the most recently downloaded video with mpv
mpv "$LOCAL_MOUNT_POINT/yt/vandaag/$(basename "$latest_file")"
	</code></pre>

<p>
Now, you can block sites while still having a way to download content. There's one problem left: newsboat won’t be able to refresh YouTube links. To fix this, I wrote a script on the Raspberry Pi that blocks domains unless any of them are on a whitelist. If so, it unblocks them instead.
</p>

	<pre><code class="language-bash">
#!/bin/bash
# ~/serverscripts/block-yt.sh

DOMAINS=("youtube.com" "www.youtube.com" "m.youtube.com" "s.youtube.com")

whitelist_count=0
blacklist_count=0

for domain in "${DOMAINS[@]}"; do
    status=$(pihole -q "$domain" 2>&1)
    if echo "$status" | grep -qi "exact whitelist"; then
        whitelist_count=$((whitelist_count+1))
    elif echo "$status" | grep -qi "exact blacklist"; then
        blacklist_count=$((blacklist_count+1))
    fi
done

# Check status and take the necessary action
if [ "$whitelist_count" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "One or more domains are whitelisted. Blocking..."
    pihole -b "${DOMAINS[@]}"
elif [ "$blacklist_count" -eq "${#DOMAINS[@]}" ]; then
    echo "All domains are blacklisted. Unblocking..."
    pihole -w "${DOMAINS[@]}"
else
    echo "Not all domains have a clear status; no action taken."
fi

pihole restartdns
	</code></pre>

<p>
We can use this <span class="underl">during the newsboat startup to briefly allow access</span>, in an automated way so that you can’t cheat.
</p>

	<pre><code class="language-bash">
#!/bin/bash

~/.config/newsboat/unblock-yt.sh &

# Wait 10 seconds and block YouTube again, independently of Newsboat
(sleep 10 && ~/.config/newsboat/unblock-yt.sh) &

newsboat
	</code></pre>

<p>
Use this to start newsboat, where <span class="highl">unblock-yt.sh</span> simply triggers the Raspberry Pi script. I found it only worked when written in this odd way.
