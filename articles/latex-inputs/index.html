        <h1>The quickest way to add and manage screenshots in LaTeX </h1>
	<p> 
	<em>
		Recently I found myself trying to categorise and order every exam question of a subject for the past five years. A rather tedious - and stupid - undertaking. It would've been impossibly slow had it not been for my screenshot setup.

		In essence, we'll first write a script that places a screenshot in the desired directory. We do this using symlinks. Then we define a snippet function to paste this screenshot in an intelligent way. 
		The idea is almost too simple to write about, but the snippet
		function was quite creative. I couldn't find anyone else doing this, so I figured this might be cool to write about.
	</p>

	<h2 id="takingshots">Taking shots</h2>
<p> 
Let's first discuss taking the screenshot. This entails making a script,
binding a key to it, keeping it in the right place.
</p>

	<h3 id="script">Script</h3>
	<p> 
	Let's first write the script for taking the screenshot. I have written a script <span class="highl">~/.local/bin/vl-ss.sh</span> -- where vl is supposed to mean vimlatex.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-bash">
#!/bin/bash

# Directory that has the symlink
base_dir=~/school/

# Checking symlink
if [ ! -L "$base_dir/current-subject" ]; then
    echo "Symlink not configured correctly"
    exit 1
fi

# Getting symlink
current_subject=$(readlink -f $base_dir/current-subject)

# Checking 'images' folder
if [ ! -d "$current_subject/images" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$current_subject/images"
    echo "Images folder didn't exist, now it does!"
fi

# filename
datetime=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')
filename="$current_subject/images/screenshot_$datetime.png"

# taking ss
flameshot gui -p "$filename"
	</code></pre>	
	<p> 
		Make sure it's executable <span class="highl">chmod +x ~/.local/bin/vl-ss.sh</span>. Notice that a very specific time is used for the filename. This will become important later when we write a function finding the screenshot that was taken last. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		I should also mention my choice of screenshotting program; flameshot. It can be installed on any linux distro and is in the AUR helper. I found this by far the best option for what I'm doing here! 
	</p>
	<h3 id="symlinks">Symlinks</h3>
	<p> 
		It's important to notice I work with a base directory and a symlink so as to use the same technique in different subfolders to my <span class="highl">~/school</span> folder. If you want to use this in a single file, <span class="underl">no need for symlinks</span>. <span class="underl">Change the code to only use a base directory.</span> 
	</p>
	<p> 
	Now let's go on to talk about this symlink, and the idea behind it.
	It's meant to be used for situatinos where you want the images in a variable place.
	Define them in your base directory to go to your desired directory. This could be done manually, or with scripts. I might later update this post to talk about automating symlink updates.
	</p>
	<p> 
		In my video example, the symlink was created as;
		<pre><code class="language-bash">
ln -s ~/school/year/semester/subject ~/school/current-subject
		</code></pre>
	</p>
	<h3 id="binding">Binding</h3>
	<p> 
	We have a way of taking and naming the screenshot. Now we shall bind it to a key. This is obviously going to work very differently for different window managers. I use DWM, and so I will demonstrate how it's done for DWM.
	</p>
	<p> 
		In your <span class="highl">~/path/to/dwm/config.h</span> 
		<pre><code class="language-bash">
static const Key keys[] = {
		...
	{ 0, 0xffc3, 			spawn, 		SHCMD("/home/user/.local/bin/vl-ss.sh") },
		...	
};
		</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p> 
		Where you should change <span class="highl">user</span> to your username. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		As you see, I bound it to a rather weird key. It will look different if you'd bind it to a normal key. Don't blindly copy this. You can use a command like <span class="highl">xev | grep 'keycode'</span> for information aout the key you'll use. 
		This part is so very specific to your system, it'd be ridiculous to go into great detail. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		To conclude this section; make sure you have a working script that will put screenshots in your directory of choice -- defined absolutely or with symlinks -- and a key bound to the script. 
	</p>

	<h2 id="snippetdefinition">A snippet</h2>
	<p> 
	Lots of troubleshooting went into the following code. I'll assume you're using ultisnips snippet-engine with standard configuration. In <span class="highl">~/.vim/UltiSnips/tex.snippets</span> add the following function;
	</p>

	<pre><code class="language-python">
global !p
import os
import datetime

def create_latex_figure(base_path, scalefac="1"):
    full_path = os.path.realpath(os.path.expanduser(base_path))
    files = [os.path.join(full_path, f) for f in os.listdir(full_path) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(full_path, f))]
    latest_file = max(files, key=os.path.getctime)
    original_name = os.path.basename(latest_file)
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
    if "_" + timestamp not in original_name:
        new_filename = f"{os.path.splitext(original_name)[0]}_{timestamp}.png"
        os.rename(latest_file, os.path.join(full_path, new_filename))
    else:
        new_filename = original_name

    figure = f"""
\\begin{{figure}}[H]
\\centering
\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth/{scalefac}]{{"{os.path.join(full_path, new_filename)}"}}
\\end{{figure}}
"""
    return figure
endglobal
	</code></pre>
	<p> 
		As you see, I wrote it so that an extra timestamp is added when this code is triggered. This solved a problem I had where making a lot of screenshots in a row threw a mysterious recursion error. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		To then use this function, define the following snippet;
		<pre><code class="language-bash">
snippet ssp "Screenshot paste" bA
`!p
snip.rv = create_latex_figure("~/school/current-subject/images")
`
endsnippet
		</code></pre>
		</p>
		<p> 
		I use <span class="highl">ssp</span> for normal images. For small images I use <span class="highl">sss</span>.
		</p>
		<pre><code class="language-bash">
snippet sss "small screenshot" bA
`!p
snip.rv = create_latex_figure("~/school/jaar/semester/vak/images", "3")
`
endsnippet
		</code></pre>
		<p> 
		Here you see I made a scalefactor of three. This should now work without any issues.
		</p>
	</p>
	<div style="padding: 10px;"></div>
	<p class="wit-kader"> 
		One problem that I thought not to be solveable; I wanted to have a snippet where you could have input choose the scaling factor. I could not get this to work. I'll leave it as a challenge for the reader!
