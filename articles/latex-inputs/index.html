        <h1>Shortcuts for managing LaTeX files you haven't seen before</h1>
	<p> 
	<em>
		Recently I found myself trying to categorise and order every exam question of a subject for the past five years. A rather tedious - and stupid - undertaking. It would've been impossibly slow had it not been for my screenshot setup. I'll discuss the technique in what follows.


	When LaTeX files become too large, most people split up their project, and make seperate files for each chapter. I always thought this to be annoying to manage. I like easily viewing chapters together without having to move through my files. I found a much quicker solution. Writing a script that will have you working in the same file, and being able to take chapters out or in with a script (and Vim). Kind of unconventional, but it works very well for me.

	<p> 
		In essence, we'll first write a script that places a screenshot in the desired directory. We do this using symlinks. Then we define a snippet function to paste this screenshot in an intelligent way. 
		The idea is almost too simple to write about, but the snippet
		function was quite creative. I couldn't find anyone else doing this, so I figured this might be cool to write about.
	</p>
<p> 
Let's first discuss taking the screenshot. This entails making a script,
binding a key to it, keeping it in the right place.
</p>

	<h3 id="script">Script</h3>
	<p> 
	Let's first write the script for taking the screenshot. I have written a script <span class="highl">~/.local/bin/vl-ss.sh</span> -- where vl is supposed to mean vimlatex.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-bash">
#!/bin/bash

# Directory that has the symlink
base_dir=~/school/

# Checking symlink
if [ ! -L "$base_dir/current-subject" ]; then
    echo "Symlink not configured correctly"
    exit 1
fi

# Getting symlink
current_subject=$(readlink -f $base_dir/current-subject)

# Checking 'images' folder
if [ ! -d "$current_subject/images" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$current_subject/images"
    echo "Images folder didn't exist, now it does!"
fi

# filename
datetime=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')
filename="$current_subject/images/screenshot_$datetime.png"

# taking ss
flameshot gui -p "$filename"
	</code></pre>	
	<p> 
		Make sure it's executable <span class="highl">chmod +x ~/.local/bin/vl-ss.sh</span>. Notice that a very specific time is used for the filename. This will become important later when we write a function finding the screenshot that was taken last. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		I should also mention my choice of screenshotting program; flameshot. It can be installed on any linux distro and is in the AUR helper. I found this by far the best option for what I'm doing here! 
	</p>
	<h3 id="symlinks">Symlinks</h3>
	<p> 
		It's important to notice I work with a base directory and a symlink so as to use the same technique in different subfolders to my <span class="highl">~/school</span> folder. If you want to use this in a single file, <span class="underl">no need for symlinks</span>. <span class="underl">Change the code to only use a base directory.</span> 
	</p>
	<p> 
	Now let's go on to talk about this symlink, and the idea behind it.
	It's meant to be used for situatinos where you want the images in a variable place.
	Define them in your base directory to go to your desired directory. This could be done manually, or with scripts. I might later update this post to talk about automating symlink updates.
	</p>
	<p> 
		In my video example, the symlink was created as;
		<pre><code class="language-bash">
ln -s ~/school/year/semester/subject ~/school/current-subject
		</code></pre>
	</p>
	<h3 id="binding">Binding</h3>
	<p> 
	We have a way of taking and naming the screenshot. Now we shall bind it to a key. This is obviously going to work very differently for different window managers. I use DWM, and so I will demonstrate how it's done for DWM.
	</p>
	<p> 
		In your <span class="highl">~/path/to/dwm/config.h</span> 
		<pre><code class="language-bash">
static const Key keys[] = {
		...
	{ 0, 0xffc3, 			spawn, 		SHCMD("/home/user/.local/bin/vl-ss.sh") },
		...	
};
		</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p> 
		Where you should change <span class="highl">user</span> to your username. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		As you see, I bound it to a rather weird key. It will look different if you'd bind it to a normal key. Don't blindly copy this. You can use a command like <span class="highl">xev | grep 'keycode'</span> for information aout the key you'll use. 
		This part is so very specific to your system, it'd be ridiculous to go into great detail. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		To conclude this section; make sure you have a working script that will put screenshots in your directory of choice -- defined absolutely or with symlinks -- and a key bound to the script. 
	</p>

	<h3 id="snippet">Snippet</h3>
	<p> 
	I'll assume you're using ultisnips snippet-engine with standard configuration. In <span class="highl">~/.vim/UltiSnips/tex.snippets</span> add the following function;
	</p>

	<pre><code class="language-python">
global !p
import os
import datetime
import re
import shutil

def create_latex_figure(base_path, scalefac="1"):
    full_path = os.path.realpath(os.path.expanduser(base_path))
    if not os.path.exists(full_path):
        os.makedirs(full_path)

    timestamp_pattern = re.compile(r"_\d{14}$")

    all_files = [os.path.join(full_path, f)
                 for f in os.listdir(full_path)
                 if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(full_path, f)) and f.lower().endswith(".png")]

    original_screenshots = [
        f for f in all_files
        if not timestamp_pattern.search(os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(f))[0])
    ]

    if original_screenshots:
        latest_file = max(original_screenshots, key=os.path.getctime)
    else:
        latest_file = max(all_files, key=os.path.getctime)

    original_name = os.path.basename(latest_file)

    # current time for new file
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

    # new filename and path
    new_filename = f"{os.path.splitext(original_name)[0]}_{timestamp}.png"
    new_file_path = os.path.join(full_path, new_filename)

    # Copy new file to new timestamped file
    shutil.copy2(latest_file, new_file_path)

    figure = f"""
\\begin{{figure}}[H]
\\centering
\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth/{scalefac}]{{"{new_file_path}"}}
\\end{{figure}}
"""
    return figure
endglobal
	</code></pre>
	<p> 
		As you see, I wrote it so that an extra timestamp is added when this code is triggered. This solved a problem I had where making a lot of screenshots in a row threw a mysterious recursion error. The timestamp is only referred to when you're using the same screenshot twice (there's no new screenshots).
	</p>
	<p> 
		To then use this function, I'll define multiple snippets for the scaling factors.
		<pre><code class="language-bash">
snippet ssone "Screenshot paste with no scaling" iA
`!p
snip.rv = create_latex_figure("~/school/current-subject/images")
`
endsnippet

snippet sstwo "small screenshot, half original size" iA
`!p
snip.rv = create_latex_figure("~/school/current-subject/images", "2")
`
endsnippet
		</code></pre>
		</p>
		<p> 
		I use <span class="highl">ssone</span> for original size. For making it half the size I use <span class="highl">sstwo</span>.
		</p>
		<p> 
		You can continue this for whatever factor you need.
	<div style="padding: 10px;"></div>
	<p class="wit-kader"> 
		One problem that I thought not to be solveable; I wanted to have a snippet where you could have input choose the scaling factor. I could not get this to work.
	</p>

	<p> 
	I will use dmenu to show a menu that contains all the chapters. Selecting a chapter will comment it out from the file you are working in.
	Running the script again and picking the same chapter will result in it being commented back in.
	<p> 
	If you run the script, and for your selection you choose a chapter then add <span class="highl">!</span>; it will comment out <span class="underl">all chapters except for</span> the selected one.
	<p> 
	Notice that <span class="underl">adding/removing chapters and altering the file is completely fine.</span> Relative placement of chapters is remembered and works as expected. You can comment out a chapter, continue working, put it back in at any time.
	<p> 
	The full script can be found <a href="https://github.com/tibo-fordeyn/DWM-fdn/blob/main/.local/bin/manage-chapters.sh" target="_blank">on my GitHub</a>. The needed Vim-mapping is obvious.
	<pre><code class="language-vim">
nnoremap <leader>mc :w<CR>:silent! call system('~/.local/bin/manage-chapters.sh ' . shellescape(expand('%:p')) . ' > /dev/null 2>&1')<CR>:e!<CR>
